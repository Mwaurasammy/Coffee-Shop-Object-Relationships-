# ☕ Coffee Shop Domain Model

Welcome to the **Coffee Shop Domain Model**! This project simulates a basic coffee shop management system using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The Coffee Shop project models customers, coffee types, and orders within a coffee shop. It's built using Python classes to manage these entities, with a focus on practicing object-oriented design patterns.

## 📋 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📦 Pipenv for virtual environment and package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee_shop.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd coffee_shop
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```

5. Once you're in the virtual environment, you can run the Coffee Shop program with the following command:
    ```bash
    python run_code.py
    ```

## 🛠 Project Structure

- `coffee.py`: Contains the `Coffee` class representing a type of coffee.
- `customer.py`: Contains the `Customer` class representing a customer.
- `order.py`: Contains the `Order` class to manage coffee orders.
- `tests/`: Directory containing test files for the different components.

## 🧪 Testing

To run the tests, use the following command inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pytest
